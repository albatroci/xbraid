-  To specify the compilers, flags and options for your machine, edit
   makefile.inc.  For now, we keep it simple and avoid using configure or
   cmake.

-  To make the library, libbraid.a,
   
         $ make

-  To make the examples
   
         $ make all

-  The makefile lets you pass some parameters like debug with 
   
         $ make debug=yes
   
   or
   
         $ make all debug=yes
   
   It would also be easy to add additional parameters, e.g., to compile with
   insure.  


- To set compilers and library locations, look in makefile.inc
  where you can set up an option for your machine to define simple
  stuff like

       CC = mpicc
       MPICC = mpicc
       MPICXX = mpiCC
       LFLAGS = -lm
